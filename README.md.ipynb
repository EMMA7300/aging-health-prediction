    "# Health Event Prediction for Older Adults with Dementia\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "A machine learning project that predicts health events in older adults with dementia using activity patterns, sleep data, and vital signs. This model achieves **87.1% ROC-AUC accuracy** in identifying patients at risk of health complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Results\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC Score: 0.871** (87.1% accuracy)\n",
    "- **Recall: 51%** - Catches over half of health events\n",
    "- **Precision: 84%** - Accurate predictions\n",
    "- **Top Predictors:** Blood pressure, heart rate, and daily activity patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "- **Activity Data:** 1,030,559 timestamped location/activity records\n",
    "- **Sleep Data:** 461,423 sleep state and vital sign measurements\n",
    "- **Physiology Data:** 17,679 vital sign readings (temperature, blood pressure, weight, etc.)\n",
    "- **Health Labels:** 608 timestamped health events across 6 event types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top Features for Prediction\n",
    "1. Diastolic Blood Pressure (10.7%)\n",
    "2. Systolic Blood Pressure (10.5%)\n",
    "3. Heart Rate (9.8%)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Project Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Exploration (EDA)\n",
    "- Analyzed activity patterns across 60 patients over 6+ months\n",
    "- Identified activity ranges: 1-912 activities per day\n",
    "- Found 17.3% of days have health events\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feature Engineering\n",
    "- **Activity Features:** 7-day averages, deviation from baseline, activity changes\n",
    "- **Sleep Features:** Sleep duration, heart rate, respiratory rate, snoring episodes\n",
    "- **Physiology Features:** Blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, weight\n",
    "- **Total Features:** 21 engineered features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Development\n",
    "- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (200 trees, max depth 15)\n",
    "- **Training Data:** 2,718 daily records\n",
    "- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20\n",
    "- **Cross-validation:** Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Results & Insights\n",
    "- Combined activity + sleep + vitals improved ROC-AUC from 0.57 to 0.87\n",
    "- Blood pressure is the strongest predictor (combined 21.2% importance)\n",
    "- Model misses 49% of events but is highly precise (84%)\n",
